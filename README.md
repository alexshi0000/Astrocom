Simple user-definable simulator rendered in real time. no strings attached, except one ...
## Description
Includes a ghetto BH implementation with option to set open angle < 0.5. Improves computational complexity but force calculation accuracy has been justly reduced. Good for larger scale computations with cheap hardware. If open angle > 0.5, algorithm returns back into traditional calculations.
