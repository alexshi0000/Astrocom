A simple to use real time user definable n-body simulator. no strings attached, except one...
## Description
Includes a ghetto 3D Barnes/Hut implementation with option to set open angle < 0.5. Improves computational complexity but force calculation accuracy justly reduced. Good for larger scale computations with bad hardware. If open angle > 0.5, algorithm returns back into generic forcestep calculations.
