A simple user-definable simulator rendered in real time. no strings attached, except one ...

## Description
Includes a BH implementation with option to set open angle > 0.5. Improves computational complexity but force calculation accuracy has been justly reduced. Good for larger scale computations with cheap hardware. If open angle <= 0.5, algorithm returns back into traditional nlogn complexity.
